<h1>The Pear Shape</h1>
   <p><ul> 
        <li><b>Pear body traits:</b>  Your lower body is wider than your upper body — in other words, your hips are wider than your shoulders. Your bottom is rounded and your waist is well-defined.</li>
        <li> <b>Your best assets:</b>  Shoulders and torso.</li>
        <li><b>Your fashion goals:</b>  Emphasize your waist and arms, add volume to your shoulders and upper body.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>  <em> "As a rule of thumb, necklines for dresses should accentuate the shoulders and waist — play around with sweetheart, scoop-neck or plunging. Opt for visually interesting hemlines on dresses that slim the hips and thighs, like the hi-lo trend or a tulip skirt," advises J'Amy Tarr, the fashion designer and fashion illustrator behind the women's luxury outerwear brand J'Amy Tarr Outerwear.</em></p>

        <h2>Dos and don'ts</h2>
<ul>
    <li> DO try A-line skirts</li>
    <li> DO keep hems of pants, skirts and dresses wide to balance the hips.</li>
    <li> DO experiment with light-colored tops and dark-colored bottoms for contrast.</li>
    <li>DO look for boat neck tops, square and cowl necklines.</li>
    <li> DO wear strapless dresses to show off arms and even out proportions.</li>
    <li>  DO try styles with ruffles on top.</li>
    <li> DO wear jackets that hit right above the waist.</li>
    <li>DO opt for pointy-toed shoes to elongate your legs.</li>
        </ul>
